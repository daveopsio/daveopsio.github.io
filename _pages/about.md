# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **DaveOpsIO** â€” a place where I share thoughts, tutorials, and lessons learned about DevOps, cloud, automation, and the side projects I find myself getting involved in.  

Here youâ€™ll find posts on cloud infrastructure, infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and the occasional deep dive into tricky problems Iâ€™ve solved with a mix of persistence and code.

## About Me

When Iâ€™m not automating things, Iâ€™m usually spending time with friends and family â€” often convincing them to play board games with me, or cooking food to share (ideally while playing board games!).  

I also help run a board game club out of the **Wauwatosa Library**. If youâ€™re local, check out **We Are Boardgame Club** on Facebook â€” weâ€™re always welcoming new players.  

Outside of tech and gaming, I enjoy cycling, lifting, and the occasional fishing expedition.

Thanks for stopping by â€” Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here!
